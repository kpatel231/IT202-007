### Hi, my name is Karan Patel and I'm currently a junior at NJIT. My major is Information Technology because I have been intrigued by computers since I was little. My hobbies are binge watching shows or movies, watching sports like basketball and football and traveling. My favorite basketball team is the Miami Heat and my favorite football team is New Orlean Saints. It's a pleasure being in this class and looking forward to learning about different things about internet applications.
